## Technologies Used:
1. **Next.js**: A React-based framework for server-rendered React applications, providing a smooth and instant browsing experience.

2. **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that enables efficient, flexible, and precise data fetching, enhancing the overall performance of the website.

3. **SWAPI Integration**: Seamless integration with the Star Wars API (SWAPI) to dynamically retrieve and display information about Star Wars characters, planets, and starships.
